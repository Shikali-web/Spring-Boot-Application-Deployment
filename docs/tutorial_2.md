# Setting Up CI/CD for Spring Boot Applications
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are crucial practices for automating the build, testing, and deployment of applications. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Spring Boot application using popular tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up CI/CD, ensure you have the following:

- A Spring Boot application configured and ready for deployment (if not, follow the [Configuring Spring Boot Application for Deployment](#) tutorial first).
- A Git repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- An account on a CI/CD platform like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

## 2. Setting Up Jenkins for CI/CD

### 1. Install Jenkins:
- Download and install Jenkins from [here](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
- Start Jenkins and configure it using the initial setup wizard.

### 2. Create a New Jenkins Job:
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard and create a new "Freestyle project."
- Configure the source code management by linking your Git repository.

### 3. Configure Build Steps:
- Add a build step to execute a shell script that builds your Spring Boot application:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 4. Configure Post-Build Actions:
- Set up post-build actions to deploy the application or push the Docker image to a registry.

### 5. Triggering Builds:
- Set up webhooks in your Git repository to trigger builds on every commit.

## 3. Setting Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 1. Create a Workflow File:
- In your Spring Boot project repository, create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: 11

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t myapp:latest .

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: docker push mydockerhubusername/myapp:latest
```

### 2. Commit and Push:
- Commit and push the workflow file to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

## 4. Monitoring the CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Jenkins:
- Monitor the build and deployment status from the Jenkins dashboard.

### 2. GitHub Actions:
- Check the workflow runs under the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.

## 5. Integrating CI/CD with Cloud Providers

### 1. AWS:
- Set up deployment steps in your CI/CD pipeline to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2.

### 2. Azure:
- Integrate with Azure Web Apps for automatic deployments.

### 3. Docker Hub:
- Automatically build and push Docker images to Docker Hub for deployment in various environments.

## Conclusion

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your Spring Boot application automates the entire process from code commit to deployment, ensuring faster delivery and more reliable deployments. Combine this with the [Configuring Spring Boot Application for Deployment](#) tutorial to fully automate your Spring Boot application's lifecycle.
